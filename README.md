# khodcoder

The problem is to implement an algorithm in order to develop another application by which we can obtain a specific output. As an example, given string "Hello world!" as the target output, our algorithm should develop an application that print that string.

This program is written in Qt (4.8)/C++, programming language for target application is brainfuck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). As an optimization problem, Genetic Programming algorithm is used to find the best result.

Population size, mutation rate, crossover, selection methods such as Q-tournament and other parameters can be modified online in the GUI.
